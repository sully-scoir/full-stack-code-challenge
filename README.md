# SCOIR Code Challenge for Full Stack Engineers
This repo contains an exercise intended for Full Stack Software Engineers.

## Instructions
1. Click "Use this template" to create a copy of this repository in your personal github account.
1. Using technologies of your choice, complete [the assignment](./Assignment.md).
    * Implement a Front End UI for selecting dogs and a Back End API for saving a user's dog selections.
    * Our preference would be to see the Front End in [React](https://reactjs.org/) with the UI implemented using [MUI](https://mui.com/), and the Back End to be in [Go](https://go.dev).
1. Update this README with
    * a `How-To` section containing any instructions needed to run/access your system.
    * an `Assumptions` section containing documentation on any assumptions made while interpreting the requirements.
1. Send an email to Scoir (code_challenge@scoir.com) with a link to your newly created repo containing the completed exercise.

## Expectations
1. This exercise is meant to drive a conversation between you and Scoir's hiring team.  
1. Please invest only enough time needed to demonstrate your approach to problem solving and code design.  
1. Within reason, treat your solution as if it would become a production system.
